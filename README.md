Working in question 1
Intel 8088 0.750 MIPS at 10.00 MHz MIPS = 0.075
Intel Core i7 Extreme Edition 980X 147 600 MIPS at 3.33 GHz  MIPS = 7.46

1 second = 1000 milliseconds 

a-) How many milliseconds would it take to run 1,000,000 8088-ISA level instructions on this 8088?

total time = 1 / (0.075 * 1 000 000)
           = 1 / 75 000 = 1.333x10^-5 seconds = 0.013 milliseconds
          
 b-) How many milliseconds would it take to run 1,000,000 Core i7 instructions on this Core i7?
 
 total time = 1 / (7.46 * 1 000 000)
            = 1 /  7 460 000 = 1.34048x10^-4 seconds = 0.0013 milliseconds
